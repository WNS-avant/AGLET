# AGLET
source code for AGLET project

In our college mini project, I assumed the pivotal role of the front-end developer, tasked with crafting a cohesive and intuitive website interface. While the initial design may have been described as somewhat plain, its simplicity served as a complementary element to the main focus of our project: the Android application. This application served as the primary interface for users, while the website acted as a centralized hub for canteen administration. Employing the robust features of the Spring Tool Suite IDE, I meticulously crafted the front-end using HTML and CSS to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience. Leveraging my proficiency in Java, I seamlessly integrated the back-end functionalities, ensuring smooth data flow and interaction with the MySQL database. To enhance the user experience further, I implemented a judicious selection of JavaScript functionalities for dynamic and responsive actions. Furthermore, the utilization of Hibernate and Spring frameworks lent scalability and efficiency to our system architecture, facilitating seamless communication between the front and back ends. This project successfully amalgamates various components to deliver a comprehensive solution tailored to the needs of administrators.
